# üè† Home Automation System with ESP32

## üìò Project Overview

This project presents a smart home automation system developed for the **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) Department Project Lab**. The system enables users to control electrical appliances in real-time using a **web dashboard**, while also offering manual control through physical switches. It is based on the **ESP32 microcontroller**, with full integration to **Google Cloud** and **Arduino IoT Cloud**, ensuring secure, scalable, and dynamic operation.

### üîë Key Highlights

- ‚úÖ ESP32-based home automation with web-based control  
- üîê Google Cloud Smart Variables used for secure cloud communication  
- üîÄ Two-way switch system: control via both physical switches and web dashboard (only when online)  
- üåê Dynamic Wi-Fi credential management through onboard web portal using WiFiManager  
- üì° Real-time monitoring and synchronization of switch states

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features and Working

### üîå Appliance Control

The ESP32 controls electrical appliances through relay modules. Users can control these relays using the **Arduino IoT Cloud Web Dashboard**. The status of each appliance is updated in real-time.

### üîÅ Two-Way Switch System (Online Mode Only)

When connected to the internet, appliances can be controlled using either:

- üñ•Ô∏è **Web Dashboard** (primary control)  
- üß≤ **Manual Switches** (secondary control)

If a user toggles an appliance manually, the web dashboard reflects the updated state instantly.

### üì≤ Dynamic Wi-Fi Configuration

Using **WiFiManager**, users can update Wi-Fi credentials without reprogramming the ESP32. On first-time setup or Wi-Fi failure, the ESP32 launches a **web portal** where users can input new credentials through a browser.

---

## üîÑ How the System Works

1. üîç On boot, the ESP32 checks for stored Wi-Fi credentials. If missing or invalid, it hosts a captive web portal using WiFiManager.  
2. üåê Once connected to Wi-Fi, the ESP32 connects to the Arduino IoT Cloud and syncs with Smart Variables.  
3. üîó Appliance control is handled through relay modules, which respond to commands from:  
   - üñ•Ô∏è Arduino Web Dashboard  
   - üß≤ Physical switches (only when internet is available)  
4. üîÑ Switch state is reflected in real-time on the dashboard, keeping both manual and web control in sync.

### üîß Installation

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Avijit89n/Home-Automation-ESP32.git
   ```

2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

3. Replace placeholders with your **Device ID**, **Secret Key**, and **Cloud Variables** from Arduino IoT Cloud.

4. Upload the code to the ESP32 using a USB connection.
